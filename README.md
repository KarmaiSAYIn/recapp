Hello, this repository is my main sort of project area for C++ graphical applications.
This is currently a fork of the [[https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine|olcPixelGameEngine]], of which I removed all but the .h file and renamed it "Engine.h";
but I will eventually make my own framework here for GUI applications.

It's not much right now, but I plan to make many projects in this repository relating to mathematics.

This respository is called "recapp," which is short for "recreational application"; as I work on this repository in a recreational but also educational manner.
